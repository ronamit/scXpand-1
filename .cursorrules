# Project Rules for scXpand

## Project-Specific Guidelines

(Add any scXpand-specific rules here as needed)

## Jupyter Notebook Editing

**CRITICAL**: When editing Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files), you MUST use the `edit_notebook` tool.
- NEVER use `search_replace`, `write`, or any other file editing tools on `.ipynb` files
- The `edit_notebook` tool is designed specifically for notebook manipulation and preserves the JSON structure
- For reference: See [cursor-notebook-mcp documentation](https://github.com/jbeno/cursor-notebook-mcp)

**Note**: General rules for Context7 and Jupyter Notebook MCP are configured globally in `~/.cursor/.cursorrules`
